    description: "A powerful, forbidden tome, the Book of Blood grants its wielder the ability to harness dark magic at the cost of their own vitality. When activated, it draws upon the user's blood to cast devastating spells, dealing high damage but reducing health with each use. Beware, for overuse can drain the life force completely, leaving the bearer vulnerable. Use wisely to strike a balance between power and survival."
